1. can calibration.py run 17 25 that stuff print out some results? I think it does output some std or something liek that and we want users to know that
2. calibration.py should save the camera yml and other related stuff under a subject folder
3. [maybe for future] it is kinda annoying to put stuff in csv... so many times i have to change the time stamp manually... and make a mistake like 1m43s video in 2m30s folder...
4. when a folder exists the program should ask you if you want to overwrite or not . currently it just crfeats another folder inside that folder
5.

1. trim 4 more kaelyn videos and run cotracker on all of the kaelyn video (10pts) 
	1. You have to check the video to make sure the tracking is correct
2. compare with ag501 (i have to teach you) and make plots.+ analyze

10 RMSE per participant. Le'ts try to get 5 people's data and say good for the part I 

Part II we might want to use some of Austin's old data (poster data) - gotta ask him


ask austin how manyframes good for calibration (plot grid)
tell austin we are now doing 15 not 1.5
